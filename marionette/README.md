# Quiz Master!

Quiz Master is Quipper's technical test. It is a single page Ruby-on-Rails app with MarionetteJS front end. The website allows users to create test questions and answers.


## To attempt and submit this test.

1. Create a fork of this repository on your own personal Github account.

2. Download your fork, start rails server, and begin making your changes.

3. When you are finished, create a pull request to merge into Quipper's version, and then send us an email to let us know you're ready for review.

4. We will close the pull request.

If you'd prefer, you may email us your commits using `git format-patch`.

## Specifications

1. There is no implementation for answering a question and knowing whether you got the answer right or wrong. Please add such implementation.

2. The Rspec tests currently fail. Please finish the model so that the tests pass.

3. The API and front end are missing some tests. Please provide either controller specs and/or feature specs to test the implementation.

4. Currently the question text is merely plain text. Please add the ability for users to provide some simple formatting.

5. If you have spare time and are feeling creative, you can upgrade the site's usability and appearance in any other way you see fit.


## Notes

1. You can add any gems or JS libraries that you think are useful for completing the test and improving the site.

2. You can change the interface in any way that you feel may improve the user experience.

3. You can use whichever technologies you see fit, for example if you prefer Handlebars to JST, or if you prefer ECMAScript6 to CoffeeScript.
